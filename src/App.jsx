/******************************************************************************
 * Note on how to pass states between components:
 *  1.) Set your "useState" variable - const [state, setState] = useState(0).
 *  2.) Make a container function for the setState function.
 *  3.) Pass the container as a prop to the component changing the state.
 *  4.) From the component, call the function "props.changeState(#)"
 * While you could just pass the "setState" as a prop, it is generally good
 * practice to create a container function so you can include other thing later.
