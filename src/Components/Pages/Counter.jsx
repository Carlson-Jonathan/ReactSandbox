      <p>
        Below is a simple counter that increments every second. Note the
        behavior of states and setInterval:
        <p className="code">setInterval( function, 1000 )</p>
        <h2
          className="main"
          style={{
            fontSize: "2em",
            margin: "0px",
            color: "maroon",
            textAlign: "center"
          }}
        >
          {number}
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This function executes the function in the first parameter every
            (parameter 2) milliseconds.
          </li>
          <li>
            In order to update the counter number to the DOM, "useState( )" is
            needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            "useState ( )" re-calls the entire React function, including any
            functions, such as "setInterval ( )", contained therein. If you
            already have a "setInterval( )" function running, you will now have
            multiple running at the same time. This will result in a{" "}
            <span style={{ color: "red", fontWeight: "900" }}>memory leak</span>
            , which will slow down, and eventually crash your browser!
          </li>
          <li>
            To prevent a memory leak, simply place your "setInterval ( )"
            function inside an if statement that only allows it to be called
            once. See this code for an example.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>
